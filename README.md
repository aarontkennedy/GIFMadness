# GIFMadness
This is an app that uses the GIPHY API to retrieve GIFs.
There are already some pre-created buttons for retrieving 
wrestling themed gifs. The javascript is mostly based around custom objects
I created to handle the response from the GIPHY API and handle the local storage.
From there, click events are calling the appropriate object methods.

You can also add your own GIF search buttons and save favorite
GIFs.  These changes are stored in localStorage.
